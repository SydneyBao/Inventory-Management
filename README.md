This project keeps track of a user's inventory using Firebase and Next.js. Users access their inventory by signing in using an email/password, email link, or Google through Firebase authentication. Users can add, edit, and delete items from their inventory stored in the Firestore database. Even if the user continues as a guest, they can sign in and save their progress at any time!
